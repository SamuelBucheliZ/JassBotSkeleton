# JassBotSkeleton

Skeleton in Java 8 for writing a Jass bot for the https://github.com/webplatformz/challenge server.

This version is based on the https://github.com/adiherzog/JassBotSkeleton skeleton.

## Build and run

The application uses Maven to manage dependencies. The bot is already fully functional and only plays allowed cards. But otherwise, it's pretty stupid ;-)

## Get startet with your implementation

Just implement `Strategy.java` and use it in `BotPlayer.java`.
