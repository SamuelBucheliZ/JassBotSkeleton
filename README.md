# JassBotSkeleton

Skeleton in Java 8 for writing a Jass bot for the https://github.com/webplatformz/challenge server.

## Build and run

The application uses Maven to manage dependencies. The bot is already fully functional and only plays allowed cards. But otherwise, it's pretty stupid ;-)

## Get startet with your implementation

Just improve the two classes `TrumpfChooser.java` and `CardChooser.java`.
